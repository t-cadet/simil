lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest .

an intoxicating experience . 
it's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible . 
less than fresh . 
move over bond ; this girl deserves a sequel . 
bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .

a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy . 
you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success . he's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness .

good , solid storytelling . 
he's the scariest guy you'll see all summer . 
perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed . 
this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
one of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the french film industry in years . 
a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear . 
the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .

morton deserves an oscar nomination . 
the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal's overweight and out of shape . 
it's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old ferris bueller . 
a romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions . 
it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
well-made but mush-hearted . 
it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny . 
chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book . 
plummer steals the show without resorting to camp as nicholas' wounded and wounding uncle ralph . it's a great performance and a reminder of dickens' grandeur . 
the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .

heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart . 
for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence . 
we hate [madonna] within the film's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground . 
whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck . 
so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie .

solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining . 
it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg's film is that it truly is romance
theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal . 
my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .

frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic , and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him . 
the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i'm afraid . 
this is nothing but familiar territory . 
they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right . 
harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
a quirky comedy set in newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that's so prevalent on the rock . 
as saccharine as it is disposable . 
the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . 
as any creature-feature fan knows , when you cross toxic chemicals with a bunch of exotic creatures , you get a lot of running around , screaming and death . on that score , the film certainly doesn't disappoint . 
hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun . 
it's a charming and often affecting journey . 
the film's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations . 
a film of epic scale with an intimate feeling , a saga of the ups and downs of friendships . 
mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king .

spielberg's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later . 
a deep and meaningful film . 
ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family . 
sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching . 
sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this . 
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy . 
a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome . 
its sheer dynamism is infectious . 
tiresomely derivative and hammily acted . 
what begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters .

features fincher's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity . 
it's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama . 
beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that's there to scare while we delight in the images . 
a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it
shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience . 
too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie . 
wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture . 
maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . 
you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling . 
an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 
a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil' bow wow . 
the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays . 
this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy . 
almost gags on its own gore . 
thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun . 
a surprisingly 'solid' achievement by director malcolm d . lee and writer john ridley . 
there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance . 
though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance . 
[hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo . 
[stephen] earnhart's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have . 
all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans . 
whether [binoche and magimel] are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria . 
its director's most substantial feature for some time . 
all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .

a truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation . 
the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus . 
the film grows on you . and how . 
two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 
if you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time . 
 . . . very funny , very enjoyable . . . 
ecks this one off your must-see list . 
the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen . 
a must see for all sides of the political spectrum
it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you . 
a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
like all of egoyan's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 
no surprises . 
there aren't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs . the big guys . 
what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor . 
 . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .

what it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart . 
everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull .

the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .

i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .

winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
a lame comedy . 
a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally . 
whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars

dense , exhilarating documentary . 
it may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but i enjoyed barbershop . it's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters .

in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan . 
two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all . 
stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap . 
in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you'd expect to see on showtime's 'red shoe diaries . '

not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare . 
it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .

the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch . 
this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues .

crummy
miyazaki is one of world cinema's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers . 
an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 
all the filmmakers are asking of us , is to believe in something that is improbable .

the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .

the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i can't remember a single name responsible for it . 
the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
a vivid , sometimes surreal , glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior . 
the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly .

a compelling film . 
i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .

creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller . 
it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so

really is a pan-american movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart . 
77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it .

raimi and his team couldn't have done any better in bringing the story of spider-man to the big screen . 
with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
 . . . a solid , unassuming drama . 
in the end , there isn't much to it .

a portrait of an artist . 
the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
i liked this film a lot . . . 
for once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own . 
nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off . 
a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not . 
a comic gem with some serious sparkles . 
this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment . 
though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .

it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
`matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy . 
adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
an enthralling , entertaining feature . 
what's next : " my mother the car ? " 
greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill
we've liked klein's other work but rollerball left us cold .

no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
this thing is just garbage . 
the complex , politically charged tapestry of contemporary chinese life this exciting new filmmaker has brought to the screen is like nothing we westerners have seen before .

very solid , very watchable first feature for director peter sheridan
a bowel-curdling , heart-stopping recipe for terror . 
brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
 . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful . 
contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .

an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller . 
generic thriller junk . teens only . 
the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
 " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment  until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief

vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
if you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy .

the quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths . 
better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . 
brave and sweetly rendered love story . 
yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth . 
a gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema
the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality .

cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh . not as good as the original , but what is . . . 
one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret .
