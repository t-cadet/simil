there's not much to fatale , outside of its stylish surprises . . . but that's ok . 
although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film doesn't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything . 
it would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of oscar wilde's classic satire . 
a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore . 
the sort of film that makes me miss hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there's hope for popular cinema yet . 
high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience . 
taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller . 
clint eastwood's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb& j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises  but still quite tasty and inviting all the same . 
a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a direct-to-video' release . 
the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
despite these annoyances , the capable clayburgh and tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age . 
with so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine . 
an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
as unseemly as its title suggests . 
it is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some . i haven't seen one in so long , no wonder i didn't recognize it at first . 
it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster .

an infinitely wittier version of the home alone formula . 
sorvino is delightful in the central role . she nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit . 
decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like . the unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful . 
the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 
piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
the weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough . 
it's all a rather shapeless good time . . .

any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors . 
the gags are often a stitch . 
a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers . 
cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
sure , i hated myself in the morning . but then again , i hate myself most mornings . i still like moonlight mile , better judgment be damned . 
offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works . 
witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image , but it's dench who really steals the show . 
it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did . sometimes , that's enough . 
the script's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off . 
fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply . 
a sudsy cautionary tale . 
while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor . 
one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true . 
in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
an overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 
the dangerous lives of altar boys' take on adolescence feels painfully true . 
the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis . 
we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood couldn't possibly fictionalize and be believed . 
this kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors . 
ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
call it magic realism or surrealism , but miss wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity . 
i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie-- for its historical significance alone . 
if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .

an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable . 
outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .

as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys' novel " the death of napoleon " and directed by alan taylor , napoleon's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn
i am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson . 
rarely has skin looked as beautiful , desirable , even delectable , as it does in trouble every day . 
 . . . quite endearing . 
antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it . 
several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare .

a miraculous movie , i'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion . 
mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare . it's also , clearly , great fun . 
this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
 . . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 . 
meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow .

a chick flick for guys . 
a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived . 
christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
' . . . mafia , rap stars and hood rats butt their ugly heads in a regurgitation of cinematic violence that gives brutal birth to an unlikely , but likable , hero . '
this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film . and just when you think it can't get any more gay , in pops nathan lane . 
a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . 
a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures .

chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
a certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents . 
egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose .

the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat .

this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them . 
overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film . 
biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame . 
a great idea becomes a not-great movie . 
we need [moore's] noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones . 
oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition . 
a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film . 
granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek . 
the structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings . 
always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
the film is bright and flashy in all the right ways . 
you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll . 
for almost the first two-thirds of martin scorsese's 168-minute gangs of new york , i was entranced . 
while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . 
jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he's easy to like and always leaves us laughing . 
an involving , inspirational drama that sometimes falls prey to its sob-story trappings . 
one thing you have to give them credit for : the message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company's previous video work . 
all leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon . 
the obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc . 
there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs . 
makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
it is amusing , and that's all it needs to be . 
this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . 
it's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered . 
at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one . 
the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . 
the script is smart , not cloying . 
perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end . . . you almost don't notice the 129-minute running time . 
sleek and arty . 
 . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . 
the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
for veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . if you're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
is this love or is it masochism ? binoche makes it interesting trying to find out . 
with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters . 
serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . 
it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
this one is strictly a lightweight escapist film . 
if you're burnt out on it's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol , it might just be the movie you're looking for . it depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept . 
a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . 
lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i couldn't help being captivated by it . 
hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
in all , this is a watchable movie that's not quite the memorable experience it might have been . 
if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann's revolution no . 9 . 
bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve . . . as far as art is concerned , it's mission accomplished . 
a conventional but heartwarming tale . 
it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy . 
the bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie . 
it's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru . 
forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
largely a for-fans artifact . 
at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles . 
occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new . 
despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed . the jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center . 
while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
i hated every minute of it . 
it's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits . if only it had the story to match . 
a lovably old-school hollywood confection . 
mildly entertaining . 
shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
whenever you think you've figured out late marriage , it throws you for a loop . 
showtime is closer to slowtime . 
both awful and appealing . 
the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by . 
a decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit franklin needs to stay afloat in hollywood . 
inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
in death to smoochy , we don't get williams' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing . 
the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there . 
follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much . 
if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five . 
those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic . '
there has to be a few advantages to never growing old . like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you're over 100 . 
majidi's direction has never been smoother or more confident . 
a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people . 
care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
a positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera . 
weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes . 
like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely . 
black-and-white and unrealistic . 
an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound . the hours is what movies are supposed to be . . . 
an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding . 
how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not . 
the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
it's absolutely spooky how lillard channels the shagster right down to the original casey kasem-furnished voice . 
os universos de chuck barris e charlie kaufman são complementares . e igualmente fascinantes . 
while the now 72-year-old robert evans been slowed down by a stroke , he has at least one more story to tell : his own . 
about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike . 
the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard . 
kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie . and adults will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film's lamer instincts are in the saddle . 
one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time . 
now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show . 
an exhilarating serving of movie fluff . 
if you ignore the cliches and concentrate on city by the sea's interpersonal drama , it ain't half-bad . 
coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else . 
lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie . 
this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow . 
it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences . . . and it's all the stronger because of it . 
seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . 
though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance . 
there has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently . . . but peter mattei's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note . 
it's clear that mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent . 
a cockeyed shot all the way . 
you have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie's failings . 
woody allen's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz . 
i have a confession to make : i didn't particularly like e . t . the first time i saw it as a young boy . that is because - damn it ! - i also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 
one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year . 
the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [this] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot . 
a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
strip it of all its excess debris , and you'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie . as it is , it's too long and unfocused . 
like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen . 
the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing . 
a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
happily for mr . chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match . 
the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past . 
a mess when it comes to the characters and writing . . . but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory . 
[director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one . 
the lion king was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on imax it seems better , not just bigger . 
a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro . . . couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment . 
by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so . 
rabbit-proof fence will probably make you angry . but it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that doesn't make you feel like a sucker . 
it's not the least of afghan tragedies that this noble warlord would be consigned to the dustbin of history . 
for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded . 
medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt . that's why sex and lucia is so alluring . 
for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . 
odd and weird . 
the quiet american isn't a bad film , it's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar . 
this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : al pacino loathing robin williams . 
what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers . 
no one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best . and if you're not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes , you've got ice water in your veins . 
the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
it was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at . 
there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out . 
how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones . 
neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula .
